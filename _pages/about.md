I am a third-year PhD student in the [Learning And Signal Processing (LASP)](https://lasp-ucl.github.io/) group at [University College London(UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) advised by [Dr. Laura Toni](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/iccs/dr-laura-toni). Prior to joining UCL, I obtained my Bachelor in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus on Machine Learning from the [American University of Beirut](https://www.aub.edu.lb/) in May 2021.

I am currently working on the development of graph generative models. I utilise diffusion models and bridges, with a specific emphasis on their applicability to healthcare and molecule generation. My research is currently focused on designing novel frameworks for graph creation and conditional generation, with aspirations to expand this work into the broader field of multimodal generative models. I specialise in graph signal processing and generative models, and I have a wide-ranging interest in the applications of machine and deep learning.
