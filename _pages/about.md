I am a final-year PhD student in Machine Learning in the [Learning And Signal Processing (LASP)](https://lasp-ucl.github.io/) group at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) advised by [Dr. Laura Toni](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/iccs/dr-laura-toni). Prior to joining UCL, I obtained my Bachelor in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus on Machine Learning from the [American University of Beirut](https://www.aub.edu.lb/) in May 2021.

I am currently committed to the development of graph generative models. My research centers on advancing graph deep learning and generative modelling algorithms, with a focus on diffusion models, flow matching models, and bridges. I develop innovative frameworks for graph generation, particularly for applications in molecule generation and healthcare. I work on enhancing both conditional and unconditional generative models by incorporating domain knowledge to improve performance, control, and adaptability. I am also interested in extending these developments to the broader field of multimodal generative models. My expertise spans in generative models, graph signal processing, and the diverse applications of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and deep learning across scientific fields.
